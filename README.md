# Gaussian-Kernel-Density-of-Sampling-Localities

Sample selection bias, a limitation of presence-only data Species Distribution Models (SDM), arises when certain landscape areas are sampled more intensely than others (Phillips et al., 2009). MaxEnt requires an unbiased sample, a condition this tool strives to meet by upweighting presence-only data points with fewer geographic neighbors. This tool establishes a Gaussian Kernel Density of sampling localities, where output values of 1 denote no sampling bias, and higher values indicate greater bias. The bias assessment can vary according to the study scope: input points could either encompass all sampling localities for a broad taxonomic group or be confined to those of a specific species. For instance, in a study on a specific Madagascar frog species, one could use occurrence points from that species alone (focusing on species-specific sampling biases), or all sampling points from all Madagascar amphibians (highlighting general spatial sampling biases and detection likelihood of the target species in all surveys, such as road-adjacent samplings).
